Welcome to my website! I am David Cavada, a passionate Computer Science student in my third year at the University of Verona. Alongside my studies, I explore a diverse range of creative and technical fields, from software development and video production to music composition. My current thesis project focuses on sustainable tourism distribution, applying machine learning and probabilistic models to promote equitable access and reduce overcrowding in popular destinations. I am also the founder of Birkengym, a platform dedicated to physical health and well-being, and the podcast "Camera417." With each project, I aim to bridge innovation and creativity, turning ambitious ideas into impactful solutions. 🎶🚀

<!-- ### Hackathons and Competitions:
I thrive in collaborative environments, which is why I frequently participate in hackathons. One highlight was HackZurich, Europe’s largest hackathon, where my team developed “Out of the Blue,” a tool transforming 2D blueprints into detailed 4D models. This project not only showcased our technical skills but also emphasized our ability to innovate under pressure. Another significant event was the Pioneers 4.0 Hackathon in the UAE, where my team created an optimization solution for tea production, winning first place and securing an internship with LIPTON tea. 🌍✨
