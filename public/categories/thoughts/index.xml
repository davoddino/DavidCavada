&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transforming the chaos of personal data into personalized, holistic health insightsâ€”to empower you to achieve your full potential!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;â€• &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wellround, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Notes&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the motto of Wellround. This is our north star. And now if you wish to follow along, I will bring you to the beginning of our Journey, navigating towards the north star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;start-with-why&#34;&gt;Start with why.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every adventure starts with a desire, a burning spirit of search. Curiosity and knowledge power the engine of our ever working mind, but sometimes the sources of energy come less and so does our motivation. Our grit is tested, and in these moments of doubt the world seems to be untractable and we fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure every single reader of this passage would have felt this, it is not only my feeling, but rather an alarming statistics. Sooner or later that might happen, and too often such minima of one&amp;rsquo;s life, might be fatal. This is our main motivation for building. This moves progress in our code and plans. It started as a personal journey, that we felt on our skin. We were able to get back up and we learned to &amp;ldquo;tryfall&amp;rdquo;. We have been lucky and we want to transform our luck into a actionable value for as many people as we can reach. This is why Wellround was founded.
We know that each one of us is unique and irreplaceable, precious. Because of this our philosophy is based on the assumption that everyone experiences and reacts to life in uncountable many different ways. It is quite impossible to cover every scenario and every possibility with traditional technology, but with the rise of smartwatches, IoT, and Large Language Models, the problem becomes very much more tractable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how&#34;&gt;How?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new technologies that are enabling this new AI revolution are the core of the solution we are proposing. By leveraging the chaos of data that everyone of us produce, we will give recommendations and actionable insights on what people can do. We will not only use data from a single source, but we are going to correlate datapoints from as many sources as possible. Even if now the sources seems not enough, the future is going to be exponential and the only limit we see is the sky. So stick with us and learn together with us what limitless really means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what&#34;&gt;What?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the simplest of the three points. Again it will be like magic. You will not be bothered by settings here or useless notifications. No nothing like that, forget all your previous experiences. Wellround will become an extension of your body, a digital twin where you can reliably get advices, help and improve to achieve your full potential. So far we only talked about technology, but we know that ultimately we are social beings, and we want also to revert the trend of people going online to solve their problems. This is why we are creating communities on our application to support meetings and activities offline as much as possible. Because in the end &amp;ldquo;No &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; is an Island&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;action-action-so-what-do-i-do&#34;&gt;Action, action, so what do I do?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you read so far, you have done the first step to achieve your full potential, congratulations ðŸŽ‰. If are already embarked in your journey, I wish you all the best,
might you achieve it in the end. If you are curious to try out our roadmap and copilot for the journey, download our app, is FREE at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;www.wellround.me&#34; &gt;www.wellround.me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A BIG day in AI</title>
        <link>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/big-day-inai/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 10:21:13 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/big-day-inai/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/big-day-inai/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post A BIG day in AI" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-big-day-in-ai&#34;&gt;A BIG day in AI
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I woke up this morning and as usual, the fatigue to go running was there. I did and ran my 6.5k in around 33 minutes, a very good time and a bit unexpected. Days like this are a sign of a good day. Then while having breakfast with my favorite news platform namely x.com, I started seeing so many posts about Gemini 1.5. Then suddenly a lot of videos and tweets about some text-video model. I was confused. I was excited. OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s name was there, it must be something big I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started watching the first video I was shocked. I thought this was light years away. And there I was with my cereal bowl and the best AI-generated videos I have ever seen. I was very excited.
At the same time I was also doubtful: &amp;ldquo;What am I studying for then&amp;rdquo;. Many things have been solved in AI already and this was a big step toward AGI, or as I would discover later to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as much excited and doubtful as I was I went back to my desk and started studying Gradient Descent and learning rates. It was the right thing to do, but still, it was weird, that I felt I knew so little yet so much had been done.
After the session, I went to lunch with my dear friends Alvaro and Hassan. We discussed about random stuff and passports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started reading about this new model and the more video I was watching the more strange I was feeling. I saw some guy on the web doing already 3d reconstruction with such videos. I am working on the same topic. I had to try so I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the meanwhile the highlight of the day and surely of the year, was that the GOAT Yann Le Cun was visiting the campus here today. When I found that out the previous day, I was thrilled. I always looked up to him as an example and took so much inspiration from his talks and works.
It was a unique moment of deep knowledge, critical thinking and first-principle reasoning. His insights were great and gave me hope for what I was thinking in the morning. My generation has the hope to still make an impact in the research field and hopefully as well for society and the world.
The questions were not many as the time was limited, and only a handful stood out to me as new and thought-provoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My supervisor asked the question (that many are wondering) if academia can still compete with the industry in terms of research. The answer wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite clear, but the main point is that academia should challenge the industry with new ideas and most importantly propose new paradigms to solve the problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second clever question worth noting is about what are the pillars that are most likely unchanging in the future of AI. The answer comprised 4 main points: backpropagation, the gradient, the minimization of an objective and the GPU. The first three are needed for the learning itself, the latest is the bottleneck of the learning process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another worth mentioning concept was the way he mentioned that the Transformer can answer any question, but it will always answer questions using the same amount of computation. This is how it is trained, and what it is supposed to do. But we don&amp;rsquo;t behave like this. If a question is harder we spend more computational power/time to come up with the correct answer. I was enthusiastic about this concept and I feel it is worth exploring more.
These are some photos I was able to take with Yann Le Cun. The whole community was trying to get some photos and this is the best I could get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![A photo all together]A sneak peek of the talk](IMG_5686.jpg)![A closer selfie with the GOAT]I hope to see him in the future as he is a great scientist and engineer as he calls himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all the day went pretty well, I was able to finish the 3D Gaussian reconstruction I started earlier, which led me to do a video and post it on YouTube. I got also some comments from the video of the campus tour of the university and I was happy to see that people are interested in what we are doing here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBUqiYNm-Rs&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might do a video about how I did it, and it is just simple software used one after the other. The peculiarity here is that the video was generated by an AI model, with emergent 3D capabilities. In other words, the 3D information was consistent throughout the video, and this is a big step toward the future of AI-generated videos.
This was also proved by the good even if not perfect results I got from the 3D reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ChatGPT</title>
        <link>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/chatgpt/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 10:21:13 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/chatgpt/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/chatgpt/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post ChatGPT" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-chatgpt&#34;&gt;What is &amp;ldquo;chatGPT&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think chatGPT needs much of an introduction. It entered in our lives in late November and it is not going to go away for a long while now. It allows user to write some prompts and get a Natural Language model to answer in any language an to pretty much any question that he get posed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one way or another, most of us has come into contact with this &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; Fanta scientific technology coming from the future. This is the trajectory we are going to follow for the next years. If there are 20 &amp;ldquo;Megatrends&amp;rdquo; well AI is going to lead them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But enough with speculations, I wanted to share my thoughts on the ethic of using such tools in every day life and where might the boundaries be, from using it to sharpen our knowledge or to fake being smart and pretend to be someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I asked to the direct interested one. ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-input&#34;&gt;The input
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is it ethical for a student to use chatGPT, in order to write faster motivational letters, and draft of emails in order to save time to concentrate more on other creative stuff, research and in general other more interesting stuff, given that is not counterproductive? Another example would be to write a motivational letter to enter a course in which he has a lot of interest but too many things to do for preparing a well written and professional text&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-answer&#34;&gt;The answer
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is ultimately up to the individual to decide whether using a tool like ChatGPT to write motivational letters or emails is ethical. However, it is important to consider the potential consequences of using such a tool. If the student&amp;rsquo;s use of ChatGPT results in a letter or email that is not their own work and does not accurately reflect their own thoughts and writing abilities, it could be considered plagiarism and may lead to disciplinary action. Additionally, if the student relies too heavily on ChatGPT and does not put in the effort to improve their own writing skills, they may not be adequately prepared for future academic or professional writing tasks. Ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s best to use these tools as a tool to help you and not a replacement of your own efforts and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;well&#34;&gt;Well
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is sharp and concise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the student&amp;rsquo;s use of ChatGPT results in a letter or email that is not their own work and does not accurately reflect their own thoughts and writing abilities, it could be considered plagiarism and may lead to disciplinary action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This short phrase, collects all my thoughts and showcase them in the most brilliant form. The reflection of our own abilities can really be seen in a text, but mostly our actions and things we did and that we take as ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-my-grandmother-thinks&#34;&gt;What my grandmother thinks
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have talked about this tool with my grandmother and as always when I talk about technology she feels far away from this witchcrafts. She said something interesting thought that can be taken as a starting point of some thoughts flow.
She said and I quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything great is done by people, just like you and if you want to do something great it has to come from yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is literally afraid of what technology can do even if she acknowledges what good has been brought by innovations. Having said that she doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to do with such things, she is too old to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finally-me&#34;&gt;Finally me
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end I don&amp;rsquo;t have any answer in this world, yet(?), but something I can tell for sure. If the goal is to go from A to B, you might decide to get by bike, by foot or even by car. I think is ultimately up to us to choose the method in which we reach any goal. Surely it has to be consistent to our thoughts, and just because we have a car and therefore we can visit all the places in a year that will take a lifetime to do by foot, means we are better off. We just had a different journey, maybe it was even worst then the second person&amp;rsquo;s one. I hope you can see the analogy here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal and the end of a person has to stay the same, with time this tool will allow to get there, with less risks, maybe even faster and with some different path. Ultimately is the goal we reach that fulfil ourselves and the journey we took there, definitely not the tools used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can learn during the process, always be integrity with ourselves and never faking our abilities and accomplishments, it will become irrelevant which tools are we using and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-am-no-oracle&#34;&gt;I am no Oracle
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how I came to think now, but I am very curios about other&amp;rsquo;s prospective and ideas. Let&amp;rsquo;s create a healthy discussion in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Realverse</title>
        <link>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/realverse/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 14:31:13 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/realverse/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/realverse/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Realverse" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;for-a-biscuit&#34;&gt;For a biscuit
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was late October and during a lesson of entrepreneurship and innovation the class moved outside to take a picture with the guest lecturer from the company &amp;ldquo;Dr. SchÃ¤r&amp;rdquo;. He told us about his personal story and his business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was walking out the building and I casually met a person, who offered me a biscuit and we just started chatting about how the seminar went and why we were there. We spent more than an hour chatting around in the cold and under the rain, so I had to take the later bus. But it was worth it all the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-a-hackathon&#34;&gt;Why a hackathon
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julian and I kept in touch, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until the hackathon of November that we met in person and went off with two different teams. In that occasion I brought what seemed to be some cutting edge technology: The oculus quest 2. My team won the hackathon and both me and Julian were thrilled by the prospective opportunities that this technology promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple week after he told to me about a long forgotten project about videogames for the world war 1 in the Dolomites. I was over the top: the technology hyped me, the victory from the hackathon gave me so much confidence and the fact that a good bunch of money was involved was all I could see at that time. So I accepted, and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We proposed the project to the enterpreneur and he was more than stunned to see what this technology would enable and the (at the time) limitless possibilities of this piece of hardware. Off we went, after a couple weeks we got an offer and without esitations and no experience whatsoever we took the plunge. We were able to get all the burocracy done with the help of some friends and we were ready to show the world what we were capable of and to start a multi-billion euro company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;well-not-exactly&#34;&gt;Well not exactly
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all about the heroic and cool part. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have any experience, no computing hardware that was capable of doing anything near what we promised. And our skills were limited to what I and him learned in the University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to learn everything and do all from scratch. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we did. I got a new Gaming computer, set up everything, and in doing so I asked a friend for advice and he ended up joining us. We were now 3 undergraduates just trying to pull off a mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-plan&#34;&gt;The plan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came back from Erasmus around August and the plan was to start from the 1st September and work until December, every day for 8 hours, 4 days a week. How long did we last?
Less than a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started strong but in the end I felt overwehlmed by the work as I put everything from my health, people to my wellbeing aside. I wanted this to be the most important thing in the next 6 months. I didn&amp;rsquo;t study German, and eventually I failed on it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t persue anything else than just working tirelessly.
I was heading directly towards the &lt;em&gt;valley of burnout&lt;/em&gt;. It was around October, nearly a year later, when most of us had resized the time allowed for this work that I found myself obsessing over something I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have. I am used to work many hours a day. But when it is for something I really care and I see my team working as me as well it is when I am pushed to my best and even further. In such a way I do grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not about the team: we were having good interactions, I learned to work in a group project as I did not during my university years, I learned new skills, learned how to manage a big project and retarget the plan once in a while. It was indeed an experience that improved me, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see myself growing in the right direction. And this insight was not clear from the beginning. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see anything that made me grow as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was clear that my head was clashing against my actions, actions made towards a project that I long searched and thrived for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pain&#34;&gt;The pain
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pain arrived from more sides. I was literally sorrounded. I started lifting weights and going to the gym regularly every day since mid October, that has been my saving. The pain was still there but I learned to manage the physical one. The worst was indeed the mental pain.
It was for me way harder to manage, because I was not used to it and didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to handle it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as always when I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do, I seek advice from books, the masters of time. I started reading, I started journaling, I started going around with a backpack filled with weights in order to feel other pain, the more manageable one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November came and I remember it as the thoughest month of the year 2022. From the first day to the very last. But if I look back now, it was the most insightful and it teached me the most.
I was also going through some kind of relationship problems and that drained much of my mental energy. I started overthinking and I can feel the effects of it still now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-this-all-relate&#34;&gt;How does this all relate?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well the insights from that month, really stood strong and gave me direction on how to come out this lonely, heavy and fearful state of mind. Because everything is in our mind, if you want it or not.
Two facts really stood by me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start planning your life from the end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much would you do to have it if you did not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first resonates with me because I finally felt, and I was able to admit to myself, that I was going down the wrong path. There is nothing wrong with making such videogames and this career path. But at the end of my life I just didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be remembered as such figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second instead, taught me some hard lessons about work, love and life. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t have this position, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done much to get into it. I was finally able to explain the situation. Also it taught me about love and what I had lost, it pushed me to try to get it back if I ever will. Because this shows how much I would have been doing, if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-be-continued&#34;&gt;To be continued&amp;hellip;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would like to find out how it did end, well you might have to wait some time, because we missed the deadline and we are still working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STAY TUNED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. let me know if you liked this personal stories and what would you like to develop more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 14:36:13 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/the-frog-in-the-pot/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/the-frog-in-the-pot/cover.JPG" alt="Featured image of post The frog in the pot" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-boiling-frog-an-analogy-for-climate-change&#34;&gt;The Boiling Frog: An Analogy for Climate Change
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the boiling frog is a well-known analogy for the gradual and insidious nature of change. The tale goes that if a frog is placed in a pot of boiling water, it will immediately jump out to safety. However, if a frog is placed in a pot of cool water that is slowly heated, it will not notice the change and eventually be boiled to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;now&#34;&gt;Now
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analogy can be applied to the current situation of climate change. The Earth&amp;rsquo;s temperature is slowly and steadily rising, and many people are not taking notice or taking action. Just like the frog in the pot, we are becoming accustomed to the gradual changes and not realizing the danger we are in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how&#34;&gt;How
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climate change is caused by human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. These actions release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and raising the Earth&amp;rsquo;s temperature. The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world, from rising sea levels and more intense storms, to droughts and wildfires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;denial&#34;&gt;Denial
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence of the reality and seriousness of climate change, there is still a significant portion of the population that denies or downplays the issue. This lack of action and denial can have dire consequences for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so&#34;&gt;So
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question remains, will we, as a society, take the necessary steps to reduce our carbon footprint and slow down climate change before it&amp;rsquo;s too late? Or will we, like the frog in the pot, be boiled to death by our own inaction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;then&#34;&gt;Then?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only time will tell, but one thing is clear: We must take immediate and decisive action to address climate change before it&amp;rsquo;s too late. The future of humanity depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;
